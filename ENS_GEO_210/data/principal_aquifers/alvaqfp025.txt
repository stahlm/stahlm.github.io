  Description:
    Abstract: 
      This data set represents the extent of the alluvial and glacial aquifers 
      north of the southern-most line of glaciation.  Aquifers are shown in the 
      States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode 
      Island, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, 
      Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South 
      Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana.

      These data delineate the areal extent of the alluvial and glacial aquifers 
      as defined in The Ground Water Atlas of The United States (GWA).
    Purpose: 
      These data are intended for use in publications, at a scale of 1:2,500,000 
      or smaller.  Due to the small scale, the primary intended use is for 
      regional and national data display and analysis, rather than specific 
      local data analysis.
    Supplemental_Information:
      This data set was constructed by combining data created for or from the 
      regional GWA chapters.  Minor aquifers that are important local sources of 
      water were mapped in some regions, so the regional maps in the GWA may 
      show more detail than this data set.  The juxtaposition of regionally 
      mapped aquifers has led to some instances where an aquifer outcrop or 
      shallow subcrop is bounded by a State line.  This is a result of the 
      regional mapping and national categorization methods used and is not meant 
      to imply a hydrogeologic change coincident with a State boundary.

      The aquifer outcrop and shallow subcrop boundaries represent broad, 
      regional categories and should not be interpreted as site-specific. 
      Comments regarding the names of aquifers or the hydrogeologic 
      interpretation of the aquifers can be directed to the U.S. Geological 
      Survey, Water Resources Division, Office of Ground Water, Roy Sonenshein, 
      sunshine@usgs.gov, 305-717-5824.

      These data were developed in conjunction with the publication of the GWA. 
      For documentation purposes, areas are referred to by their corresponding 
      GWA chapter letter, or by State.  This list shows the relationship between 
      State names and GWA chapters:

      Although these spatial data can stand alone, it may be helpful to refer to 
      the printed GWA chapters when using the data.  Note that the coastline was 
      drawn from the National Atlas shoreline files and may not match the 
      coastline shown in the GWA.

      Although this Federal Geographic Data Committee-compliant metadata file is 
      intended to document the data set in nonproprietary form, as well as in 
      Arc/INFO format, this metadata file may include some Arc/INFO-specific 
      terminology.

Data_Quality_Information:
  Attribute_Accuracy:
    Attribute_Accuracy_Report:
      The source data was checked using standard USGS review procedures.
      Attributes were checked by plotting the coverage and reselecting for the 
      different values.
  Logical_Consistency_Report: 
    Polygon and chain-node topology are present.  Every polygon has a label.
  Completeness_Report:
    This data set represents the extent of the alluvial and glacial aquifers 
    north of the southern-most line of glaciation.  Aquifers are shown in the 
    States of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Rhode 
    Island, New Jersey, New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Michigan, 
    Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Iowa, Missouri, Kansas, Nebraska, South 
    Dakota, North Dakota, and Montana.

    The extent is based on the best available printed sources on the subject of 
    aquifer extents.  There is the potential that better data are available at 
    the local level.

    Process_Step:
      Process_Description:
        Alluvial and glacial aquifer data were taken from digital files created 
        in Adobe Illustrator from the individual Ground Water Atlas chapters.  
        The individual chapter Illustrator files were edgematched and combined 
        into one file.  Where polygons ended at a salt or freshwater shoreline, 
        USGS 2 million-scale digital data were used for the shoreline.  The 
        limit of glaciation was determined from ATLAS-GEO.  Where more than 
        one line exists in an area, the southernmost line was used.  The 
        final Illustrator file was exported into a DXF file. 

        The remaining steps were completed using ArcGis 8.1 Workstation.  The 
        DXF file was converted to a coverage.  Using the TRANSFORM command, the 
        coverage containing the digitized aquifer extent lines was rubbersheeted 
        to the coverage containing registration tics, it was then projected from 
        geographic coordinates to the Albers Equal-Area Conic projection.  An 
        RMS error of less than 0.004 was accepted.  If the RMS error was greater 
        than 0.004 the location and values of the latitude/longitude points were 
        verified.

        The coverage was cleaned, the topology was built, and labels were added.

        Attributes were added for the aquifer name (AQ_NAME), aquifer code 
        (AQ_CODE), rock name (ROCK_NAME), and rock type (ROCK_TYPE).  

        The following items were verified:
        >--Transformation RMS error (below 0.004)
        >--Arcs match the scanned film (no gaps between the plot and the 
        >  compilation)
        >--Arc and polygon topology exists
        >--Coverage has a coordinate system defined
        >--Attributes aq_name and aq_code have been added and populated 
        >  correctly
        >--Necessary files exist to redo any step

      Process_Description:
        This step was done on an NT workstation.  After plotting the file at 
        1:2,000,000, the lines were checked against the documented sources.  If 
        needed, the lines were corrected to better represent the source data, by 
        either reshaping the arc, digitizing new lines or polygons, or deleting 
        polygons.  The file was converted to NAD83 in geographic coordinates, 
        and saved in shapefile format.
