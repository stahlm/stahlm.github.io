```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
## assigning mpg to a new object
fuel_data <- mpg
```

```{r}
str(fuel_data)
```
How many variables are there? 11
How many observations? 234
What does chr, int, and num mean in the output above? chr is a string (type of car), int is an integer and num is a number
```{r}
head(fuel_data, n = 6)
```
What do the disp, cyl, and cty columns represent? disp = engine displacement, in litres. cyl = number of cylinders. cty = city miles per gallon.
What website was the data obtained from? https://fueleconomy.gov/
```{r}
dim(fuel_data)
```
Number of rows? 234
Number of columns? 11
```{r}
n_rows <- 234
n_cols <- 11
```
```{r}
summary(fuel_data)
```
For highway driving how many miles per gallon does...
  The most fuel efficient vehicle get? 44
  The least fuel efficient vehicle get? 12
What is the average miles per gallon for city driving? 16.86
```{r}
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, hwy2cty = hwy/cty)

fuel_data$hwy2cty
```
Examine
  Is there any vehicle that gets better gas milage in the city compared to the highway? All vehicles get better gas milage on highway
  Is there any vehicle that has twice as good gas milage on the highway relative to the city? no
  What is the largest ratio between highway and city gas milage? 1.666667
```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = hwy , y = displ))
```
How does the displacement influence the fuel economy? The higher the displacement the lower the fuel.
Do any points appear to be outliers from the observed relationsuip? Any thoughts on what might explain these outliers? The two dots above 40 for hwy are outliers
```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = displ , y = hwy, color = class))
```
What new information did this provide us with?
  Can we say more about factors affecting fuel economy? Although the smaller cars such as subcompact and compact cars have a smaller engine displacement their highway miles are much greater than those who have larger engine displacements, such as the suv and pickup. 
  Can we explain some of the outliers? There are two outliers that have small engine displacements but very high highwat miles per gallon, both of which are subcompact. There is also the outlier of the smaller car, 2seater, which has the largest engine displacement but only has an average for highway miles per gallon.
```{r}
us_makes <- c("chevrolet" , "dodge" , "ford" , "jeep" , "lincoln" , "mercury", "pontiac")
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, region = if_else(manufacturer %in% us_makes,"US", "Foreign"))
```
What is the new variavle region telling us? If the car is foreign or from the US
Can you breifly explain the logic and steps taken to create the variable region? The first function lists the cars that are made in the US. The second code determines if the cars are under us_makes meaning their region is "US" and if the car name does not fall under us_makes it's region is foreign

```{r}
## How do manufacturers alter the information gathered by the previous graph? Is class that much different?
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = displ , y = hwy, color = manufacturer))
```
The original outliers that were subcompact with low engine displacement but high highway miles per gallon both come from the Volkswagen company. So, not only are they subcompact cars but they are manufactured by the same company. Another interesting observation is that some cars that have the same engine displacement and the same manufacturer have different highway miles per gallon. This is in the case of ford around the 4.5 engine displacement who has 3 points all only slightly higher than the previous. This is also the case for subaru on the 2.5 line which has the same engine displacement and 5 points slightly higher than the previous. Another interesting observation is that the manufaxcturer chevrolet have the majority of their points between 5-7 engine displacement (the highest levels of displacement possible) and yet they have average and below average highway miles per gallon. Whereas the manufacturer volkswagen has most of its points around 2 engine displacement but has the highest highway miles per gallon. Some may take this information to state that volkswagen is a better car than chevy because it has a smaller engine displacement with a larger highway miles per gallon.
```{r}
## How do city miles per gallon and highway miles per gallon compare? Does a specific manufactor exceed both? Does a specific manufactor fail in both?
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = hwy , y = cty, color = manufacturer))
```
Again, volkswagon is exceeding expectations in highway miles per gallon but is also exceeding them in city miles per gallon. It appears that some manufacturers are also lacking in both, such as the lincoln who is between 10-15 for city miles per gallon and between 15-20 in highway miles per gallon. Overall, there is no manufacturer that exceeds in either city miles per gallon or highway miles per gallon (all points are placed similarly for city miles per gallon and highway miles per gallon).
```{r}
## How do regions display when looking at engine displacement and highway miles per gallon? Are foreign cars better or US cars? Can you make an opinion with this information?
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = displ , y = hwy, color = region))
```
Surprisingly, this graph showed that almost all foreign cars are clumped together and all US cars are clumped together. I know that it is preferable to have more miles per gallon no matter if you are on counting for city miles or highway miles. As someone who knows nothing about cars I am not entirely sure what engine displacement has to do with anything other than assuming engine displacement has something to do with the engine size. From all of my graphs above I have noted that in all cases a larger engine displacement does not equal higher highway miles per gallon. It is interesting to see that the regions are clumped together with foreign cars being on the left side of the graph (small displ and large hwy) and US cars being on the right side of the graph (large displ and small hwy). There are some cars in both regions that are in the middle of the graph but the majority of foreign have high highway miles per gallon where US is low. After reviewing this graph I have come to the conclusion that foriegn cars are better.
