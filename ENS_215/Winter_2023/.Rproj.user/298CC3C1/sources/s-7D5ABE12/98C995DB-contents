## Introduction ##  

  This data set is a large chunk of data from the UN's FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization).
  There are 22 variables that range from the country name of origin for the dam/reservoir to the capacity
  for storage in millions of meters cubed (m3). There are 14,216 observations (dams/reservoirs)
  in the data set. The most pertinent variables are the area (Reservoir_area_km2), the capacity                         (Reservoir_capacity_million_m3), the dam height (Dam_height_m), and the country (Country). 
  There is also data about the usage of the dam using binary "0"s and "1"s to mean "no" and "yes"
  respectively. The first dam on the record in order of oldest completed to youngest was built
  in the year 1000 in India. The most recent one was completed in 2013. The dams range in size
  from having an area of 0.0000 km^2 to ~51,000 km^2. Dams are a huge part of human history due to their
  many uses including energy production, irrigation, water supply, flood control etc. In comparing
  global data for dams over time, we can make conclusions about human advancement, regional dam
  building projects and specifications, and even global water usage. 



### Loading in tidyverse and the dam data ### 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
dams_data <- read_csv("https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Data/Dams_FAO_SelectCols_LabData.csv")
```
### A quick analysis of dams_data to understand the variables ###  

```{r}
dams_data
```
### Scatter plot of relationship between reservoir storage and area ###  

```{r}
dams_data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Reservoir_area_km2, y = Reservoir_capacity_million_m3, color = Continent)) +
  geom_point() +
  
  
  scale_x_log10() +
  scale_y_log10()
```

**Comments:** The capacity and area seem to be fairly strongly linearly related. They form
a general straight line with lots of data points clumped in the middle, with several outliers
on either side. There are a lot of dams in Asia, so they seem to block out data from other
continents. There are many dams in Asia with the exact same area, but vastly different
capacities suggesting that the areas were probably rounded to be standardized numbers
which could be used to group the reservoirs into categories "small", "medium", "large"
for example.


### Scatter plot of relationship between reservoir storage and dam height ###  


```{r}
ggplot(data=dams_data,aes(x=Dam_height_m, y=Reservoir_capacity_million_m3, color = Continent)) +
geom_point() +
  
scale_x_log10() +
scale_y_log10()
```

**Comments:** Dam height and capacity appear to also be fairly closely linearly related. 
There are several outliers and some of them appear to have 0 or very little 
reservoir capacity. There are also some outliers that just don't follow a 
linear relationship. Those outliers tend to have higher dam height and not
as much capacity as its counterparts. In the American data there are dams
that have the same height listed which may suggest that the heights were
rounded to standardize the dams into different height categories.

### Summary table of the average heights, areas, and storages grouped by continent ###  

```{r}
dams_data %>% 
group_by(Continent) %>% 
summarise(mean_height = mean(Dam_height_m, na.rm=T), mean_area = mean(Reservoir_area_km2, na.rm=T), mean_capacity = mean(Reservoir_capacity_million_m3, na.rm=T))
```
**Comments:** This table shows averages of dam height and reservoir area and capacity by 
continent. On average, European dams are a lot taller than other continents', African 
reservoirs have a much larger area, and and capacities for European dams are higher.
The European capacity being higher than the African makes sense because if European
reservoirs are deeper, they can have greater capacity without having a large surface
area. 

### Boxplot showing how the reservoir storage capacities vary across continents ###  

```{r}
ggplot(data=dams_data, aes(Continent, Reservoir_capacity_million_m3, color = Continent)) +
geom_boxplot() +

scale_y_log10()
```

**Comments:** The averages for all continents are fairly similar around 1e+02. Africa has one really low outlier
and the Americas and Asia have a wider range within the box.



## Additional Analysis ##  


### Graph showing the number of dams of time since 1800 ###  

```{r}
ggplot(data=dams_data, aes(Year_completed, na.rm = T, color = Continent)) +
geom_density() +
xlim(1800,NA)
```

**Comments:** This graph shows dams completed over time. It just uses the "Year_completed" variable
and the graph creates a smooth line using the "_density" function which creates a linear
line.I changed the limit to start expressing dams only in 1800. There were several dams
built before 1800, but the majority of them were built post-1800. Africa had a huge peak of
dam completions after 1975 which aligns with lots of revolutions and victories against 
colonial powers for many African nations.


## New Zealand Data ##


```{r}
dams_data %>% 
  filter(Country == "New Zealand")
```

**Explanation and analysis:** 
I filtered the data to only get New Zealand data. None of their dams/reservoirs are used 
for irrigation which makes sense based on their average rainfalls. Most of them are used
for hydroelectricity which also makes sense. there are pretty consistently spread out over
the decades except for the 1900s, 1910s, and 1940s and they slow down and stop production
of new dams in  the late 1980s. The decades where there aren't that many dams being built
makes sense because of World Wars and the fact that New Zealand is a British colony with 
compulsory military service for all men of a certain age meant there was not enough 
laborers or demand to build new dams/reservoirs during those times. Production of new hydro
features slowed down in the late 1980s because the country ran out of places to put them
that didn't violate Maori land treaties. 


## Armenia Data ##

### First exploring Asian data to see a pattern and narrow down the focus of analysis ###  

```{r}
summary_table <- dams_data %>% 
  filter(Continent == "Asia") %>% 
  select(-ISO_code, -Sedimentation_percent, -Other, -Latitude, -Longitude, -Continent, -River) %>% 
  arrange(Country, Dam_height_m) %>% 
  relocate(Dam_height_m, Hydroelectricity, .before = Year_completed)

summary_table
```


**Comments:** Armenia has 30 dams on the Araks basin and only 9 of them are used for hydroelectric purposes.


### Specific Armenia Analysis ###  

```{r}
armenia_table <- summary_table %>% 
  filter(Country == "Armenia", Major_basin == "Araks") %>% 
  arrange(desc(Hydroelectricity))

armenia_table
```


**Comments:** Only one of the dams is listed for water supply and a different one for recreation with the 
majority being used for irrigation. The climate of this region is very dry, so the majority of dams being
used for irrigation makes logical sense. However, if only one dam is used for water supply and the region
is fairly arid, where are most Armenians near the Aras River getting their drinking water from? Probably 
groundwater, but as climate change affects rainfall and snow melt in the region, where will Armenians turn
for drinking water (Britannica).


### About the Araks River in Armenia ### 


The Araks (Aras) River spans 665 miles and forms part of the border between Turkey and 
Armenia before ultimately emptying into the Caspian Sea. It is one of the largest rivers
in the Caucasus and yet I've never heard of it. The river has a very long history of human
civilization along its banks (Britannica).

## Conclusion ##

Using data about dams and reservoirs from around the world, there are clear patterns across
continents and during periods of economic unrest. Very few dams were built during World Wars
and the period following them. European dams are taller to produce a greater capacity without
taking up too much horizontal space because Europe is crowded and running our of places to
put reservoirs and dams. The more rural and country is, the more variation in can have in its
dams. Paired with knowledge about global weather patterns over time and general political 
knowledge on a country to country basis, this data could be useful in many different forms
of study. For me, New Zealand is relevant and recent in my mind, so I wanted to see if, a. 
I recognized any of the dams (I did and saw several of the large lakes that had dams listed)
and b. how many were used for hydroelectric production because that is a large source of
power for the country. This data was very informative and fun to work with, so I enjoyed
this lab a whole lot.
