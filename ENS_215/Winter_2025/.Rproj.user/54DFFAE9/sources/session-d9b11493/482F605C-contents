Load in air_lichen_queryFull.xlsx
```{r}
full_elementalAnalysis_data <- read_csv("./air_lichen_queryFull.csv")
#got data from "https://gis.nacse.org/lichenair/index.php?page=query&type=analysis", selected all areas of interest, all tissue data, all plot data, all lichen names
```


Rename col:
```{r}
full_elementalAnalysis_data <- full_elementalAnalysis_data %>%   
  rename(Species_Name= Name)
```


#### make char numeric from ele concentration
(some N.D. was not defined- given that there were few of these and I didn't know what they were we made them NAs. (could have been "not determined" or "not detected" which are different))
```{r}
full_elementalAnalysis_data <- full_elementalAnalysis_data %>%
  mutate(across(contains(" dw"), as.numeric)) %>%
  mutate(`Distance from coast (miles)` = as.numeric(`Distance from coast (miles)`),
         `Precipitation (cm/yr)` = as.numeric(`Precipitation (cm/yr)`)
         
         )
```

```{r}
samples_full <- full_elementalAnalysis_data %>% 
  filter(!is.na(`Latitude (decimal degrees)`)) %>% 
  filter(!is.na(`Longitude (decimal degrees)`))

samples_full <- st_as_sf(samples_full,
                       
                         coords = c("Longitude (decimal degrees)", "Latitude (decimal degrees)"))
```



```{r}
leaflet() %>% 
  addProviderTiles(provider = providers$Esri.NatGeoWorldMap) %>% 
  addGlPoints(data = samples_full, fillColor = "Lead (ppm dw)")
