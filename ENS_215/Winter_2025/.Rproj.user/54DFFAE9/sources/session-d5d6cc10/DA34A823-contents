### Assignment: `r name_assign`

### Code style and strategy: 
Clear and correct implementation of your code.  Not overly necessary in this lab, but make sure to comment your code (especially in future labs as the code gets more involved).  

I noticed that some of the code in your Rmd file does not appear in your knit HTML document.  I tested your code and it all runs, so it appears that you did not knit your final Rmd document (thus your knit file only has some of the code and output that you intended to include).  Always make sure to knit your Rmd file once you've finished all of your coding and then submit the HTML file that is generated.  

**`r (paste0(score_code,"/",3))`**

### Presentation of results:
Results are reasonably clear in their presentation.  In future labs you will want to incorporate additional text/document formatting (e.g., bullet points, bold/italics, additional line breaks between sections) to help make presentation even clearer/more organized.  

**`r (paste0(score_results,"/",3))`**  

### Achievement, mastery, creativity:
Good application of the tools/skills learned thus far.  You work collapsing the transmission types into two groups was a good idea (however this code only appeared in your Rmd file and was not in the HTML file you submitted).  

FYI, in the coming lecture we will see how to use geom_jitter() to help minimize overlapping of points on scatter plots.  

**`r (paste0(score_achieve,"/",3))`**  

### Discussion:
You correctly answered some of the lab prompts, however you did not have any additional discussion.  In particular, you had no discussion associated with your additional analysis.  Make sure to include a much more thorough discussion section in future labs.  It is important that you interpret and discuss your results.  

A short introduction providing some background on the research topic and the motivation for your analysis would further strengthen your lab.

**`r (paste0(score_discuss,"/",3))`**  

### Ease of access for instructor:
Correct files submitted and files run properly.  

**`r (paste0(score_access,"/",3))`**  

### Overall Grade: 
```{r echo = F, message= F, warning= F}
df_student <- tibble::tibble(score = c(score_code, score_results, score_achieve, score_discuss, score_access))

df_student <- df_student %>%

### Presentation of results:
Results are clearly organized and presented.  Good use of color aesthetic to represent a third variable within your scatter plots.  Figures are informative and properly constructed.

Your "Displacement vs. CTY with Color-Coded Types of Transmission" figure probably is pushing the limit of the number of colors that can easily be discerned by a reader.  Try collapsing the transmission variable into a smaller set of categories.  

Good use of numbering/bullets to highlight your responses to questions.

Excellent presentation of your results!  

Your report is clearly organized (good use of section headers).  Good use of bullets to organize some of your responses.  I would suggest adding a section header to indicate where your additional analysis section begins.  

Good use of code styling (e.g., black code blocks with light text) to make your code blocks easier to read.  

Figures are well made and appropriately chosen for your particular analysis.  I would suggest not coloring points by manufacturer (too many categories and thus too many colors, which are hard for the reader to differentiate between).  

Note: to prevent the text from wrapping around the side of your figures in your knit html file, you will want to add a line break between code blocks and your text within your Rmd file.

### Presentation of results:
Results are presented clearly and figures are properly made.  Good use of italics to highlight your figure captions.

You should make additional use of section headers, in particular use section headers to identify the section(s) with your additional analysis.  

When using color for categorical values (e.g., manufacturer) in figures it can become difficult to interpret the colors when there are a large number of categories (> 7 or so).  In cases where you have many categories you may want to reconsider the use of color to represent the categories or you might consider re-categorizing the data into a smaller number of categories (when applicable).  


**`r (paste0(score_results,"/",3))`**  

### Achievement, mastery, creativity:
Your work demonstrates clear understanding and application of the concepts we've covered thus far.  Good use of faceting in some of your figures.  Also good use of color to represent year in your hwy vs. displ figure.

FYI, there was an error in one of your faceting attempts.  When you tried to facet by *class* it looks like you forgot the "+" sign after your geom_point() and thus the faceting did not work.

**`r (paste0(score_code,"/",3))`** 

### Presentation of results:
Results are reasonably clearly presented/organized.  I would suggest making greater use of section/sub-section headers to clearly identify sections.  By making greater use of headers your report will be easier to read.  

Note: to prevent the text from wrapping around the side of your figures in your knit html file, you will want to add a line break between code blocks and your text within your Rmd file.  

Your figure where the points are colored by "model" is interesting, however the color is not really readable since there are so many colors.  When using color for categorical values (e.g., model) in figures it can become difficult to interpret the colors when there are a large number of categories (> 7 or so).  In cases where you have many categories you may want to reconsider the use of color to represent the categories or you might consider re-categorizing the data into a smaller number of categories (when applicable).
