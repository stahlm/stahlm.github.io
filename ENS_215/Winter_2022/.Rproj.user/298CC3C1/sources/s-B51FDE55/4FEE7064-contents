EPA Cars Lab

Introduction
Carbon emissions associated with driving cars is a large contributor to climate change. It's important to have an idea of common CO2 emissions, as the only way to lessen your impact is to drive a more fuel efficient car, or go electric; however, our current electric grids are not sufficient to support a national switch to EVs, so interrogating data on existing automobiles is a practical measure in the meantime.

```{r}
library(tidyverse) #load tidyverse & its libraries
```

```{r}
fuel_data <- mpg
view(fuel_data) #this line and the above creates a new object named fuel_data and view it
str(fuel_data) #examines the structure of the data set
```
there are 11 variables in the data set with 234 observations
chr means the data is characters
num means the data is numerical
int means the data is integer

```{r}
fuel_data[1:6,] #displays the fisst 6 rows
?mpg #inspects mpg data
```
cyl is the number of cylinders
displ is the engine displacement in liters
cty is the city miles per gallon
The information was taken from https://fueleconomy.gov/.

```{r}
dim(mpg) #determines the number of rows and columns
```
there's 234 rows and 11 columns

```{r}
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, hwy2city = hwy/cty) #add a new column to fuel column. I did it both ways and added it twice by accident
summary(fuel_data$hwy2city > 2)
summary(fuel_data$hwy2city < 1)
```
hwy2city divides gas milage on the highway by the gas milage in the city for each car model. No cars are more fuel efficient in the city, as they would have a ratio of <1. None are more than twice as efficient on the highway, as these would be >2.

```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(hwy, displ))
```
With a high engine displacement, you generally have a worse gas mileage. Low displacement cars tend to be extremely efficient.
There are a few outliers, most of which are fancy sports cars

```{r}
us_makes <- c("chevrolet","dodge","ford","jeep",
              "lincoln","mercury","pontiac") # this lists manufactures based in the US

fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, region = if_else(manufacturer %in% us_makes,"US","Foreign") ) # this uses an if_else statement to define the category "Foreign" as all cars not belonging to the vector us_makes
```


the following is an analysis of why nobody should buy a pickup truck, which is further explained below.
```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(class, hwy)) #plots vehicle class vs highway gas mileage
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(class, cty)) #plots vehicle class vs city gas mileage
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_boxplot(aes(class, displ))
```

To analyze why nobody should by a pickup, I plotted data from the dataset fuel_data on several boxplots. The first plotted vehicle class on the x-axis and fuel efficiency on the y to make a comparison between each of the classes (those being 2-seaters, compact cars, midsize cars, minivans, pickup trucks, subcompact cars, and SUVs). The second plotted the same data, but for fuel efficiency on the highway rather than the city--cars tend to get significantly worse mileage in the city, so this comparison is relevant. The lasst graph shows engine displacement vs vehicle class, to see if the larger engines contribute to their fuel inefficiency.

The plots each tell a clear story about pickup trucks, but also SUVs. In both box plots on the fuel efficiency of trucks, they have the lowest average fuel efficiency meaning that they're not practical on the highway (in fact, barring SUVs, they do much worse than every other vehicle class). The higher engine displacement probably adjusts for a higher total vehicle weight, but the end result is that pickup trucks simple guzzle gas. SUVs have similar problems, and score almost as low as trucks for freeway fuel efficiency, but manage to have a lower average efficiency for city driving.
Unless you work with a moving service or have a legitimate reason to own a pickup, I don't think they're worth buying at least for fuel economy reasons. Considering carbon emissions associated with a 3.5 ton Dodge^tm Ram(R), I find them near impossible to justify.
