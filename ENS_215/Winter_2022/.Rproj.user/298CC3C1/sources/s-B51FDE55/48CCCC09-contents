# Step 1 - Set Up
```{r}
library(tidyverse) #Load tidyverse
fuel_data <- mpg
```

# Step 1 - Analysis
## str funtion
```{r}
str(fuel_data) 
```
### 234  
### chr is charecter, int is integer, num is numerical. These define what kind of data is present.   

## Row select
```{r}
fuel_data[1:6,] #select the first 6 rows
```
### disp is the engine displacement in litres, cyl is the number of cylinders, and cty is city miles per gallon.  
### https://fueleconomy.gov/  

## Row and Column Count
```{r}
nrow(fuel_data)
ncol(fuel_data)
n_row <- nrow(fuel_data) #set the number of rows
n_col <- ncol(fuel_data) #set the number of columns
```
### 234  
### 11  

## Summary
```{r}
summary(fuel_data)
```
### 44 miles per gallon, 12 miles per gallon  
### 16.86 miles per gallon  

## Create hwy to cty ratio
```{r}
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, hwy2cty = hwy/cty)
fuel_data$hwy2cty
```
```{r}
fuel_data$hwy2cty > 1 #check if hwy is better than cty
```
### No vehicles have better cty than hwy  
```{r}
fuel_data$hwy2cty > 2 #check  if hwy is 2x better than cty
```
### No vehicles have 2x the hwy than cty  
```{r}
max(fuel_data$hwy2cty) #Max hwy2cty value
```
### the largest ration is 1.666667  

# Step 1 - Graphing

```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(y = hwy, x = displ)) #Create scatter plot of 
```
### The lower the engine displacement the higher the highway miles   
### the point with the highest displ at 7 doesnt have the lowest mileage and is actualy in the middle.  


```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(y = hwy, x = cyl, color = class))
#hwy vs cyl with class being colors
```
### having less cylinders causes better hwy mgp.   
### 2 cars have 5 cylindes which is a weird design. We can tell it wasnt the best as not many other copied it.  

## Create New Vaariable
```{r}
us_makes <- c("chevrolet","dodge","ford","jeep","lincoln","mercury","pontiac") # US cars
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, region = if_else(manufacturer %in% us_makes,"US","Foreign"))
fuel_data$region
```
### This variable tells us if the car is from the US or foreign.  
### The steps first defined what was concidered a US make and called it us_makes. Next the mutate funtion was used to add region to fuel_data. This region feild was defined by stating that if the manufacturer feild was one of the brands in us_makes then it would be called "US" otherwise it woul dbe called "Foreign".  

# Step 1 - Additional Analysis
```{r}
unique(fuel_data$trans) #list unique trans data
trans_auto <- c("auto(l5)", "auto(av)", "auto(s6)", "auto(l4)", "auto(l3)", "auto(l6)", "auto(s5)", "auto(s4)") #Create a new field where all automatic trans are included
fuel_data <- mutate(fuel_data, a_m = if_else(trans %in% trans_auto,"Auto","Manual")) # mutate the new field
```

```{r}
fuel_data$a_m #Print a_m
```

## Create graph of a_m vs hwy
```{r}
ggplot(data = fuel_data) + geom_point(aes(x = a_m, y = hwy))
# greated graph showing hwy mpg for automatic and manual cars
```
### you can see a slight trend showing that manual has a slightly higer average mpg then automatic. 

# Step 2 - Set Up

```{r}
vehicles <- read_csv("vehicles.csv")
```
# Step 2 - Analysis
```{r}
vehicles$ch <- vehicles$highway08 / vehicles$city08
# create hwy/cty field
```

```{r}
ggplot(data = vehicles) + geom_point(aes(x = displ , y = ch, color = year ))
```
### We can see that similarly to the previous data more displecement means higher highway mileage ### We can also see that newer cars seem to be better.
