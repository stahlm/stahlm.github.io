## Seasonality indices


Many environmental parameters (e.g., precipitation, temperature, vegetation abundance,...) experience distinct seasonal cycles.  Understanding the characteristics/dynamics of these seasonal cycles can shed light on the underlying processes that control these cycles as well as provide useful information for understanding the environmental/societal implications of these cycles.  For example, seasonal variations in precipitation can have a many important implications ranging from controlling the timing of floods and droughts, influencing the seasonal growth of vegetation/crops, affecting the transmission of waterborne diseases, and impacting the emergence of insect populations and associated diseases (e.g., Malaria).  



Let's take a look at monthly precipitation for Boston and San Francisco to highlight some features of seasonal cycles.  

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(GSODR)

library(tmap)
library(sf)

```

```{r echo = F}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stahlm/stahlm.github.io/master/ENS_215/Winter_2022/Lectures/compute_seasonality_indices.R")
```



```{r}

met_sfo <- get_GSOD(years = 2011:2021, station = "724940-23234")
met_bos <- get_GSOD(years = 2011:2021, station = "725090-14739")
```





```{r}

monthly_met_sfo <- met_sfo %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, MONTH, STNID) %>% 
  
  summarize(observation_value = sum(PRCP, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(MONTH, STNID) %>% 
  summarise(observation_value = mean(observation_value)) %>% 
  
  rename(group_name = STNID, Month = MONTH)



monthly_met_bos <- met_bos %>% 
  group_by(YEAR, MONTH, STNID) %>% 
  
  summarize(observation_value = sum(PRCP, na.rm = T)) %>% 
  
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(MONTH, STNID) %>% 
  summarise(observation_value = mean(observation_value)) %>% 
  
  rename(group_name = STNID, Month = MONTH)


monthly_met_bos_sfo <- monthly_met_bos %>% 
  bind_rows(monthly_met_sfo) %>% 
  mutate(loc_name = if_else(group_name == "725090-14739", "Boston", "San Francisco"))
```




```{r}
monthly_met_bos_sfo %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = factor(Month), y = observation_value )) +
  geom_col() +
  
  facet_wrap(~ loc_name) +
  
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Precipitation (mm)",

```

What can we say about the seasonal cycles of precipitation in Boston and In San Francisco?  How would you describe these cycles?  What features stand out?  How do the cycles between the two locations compare and contrast?  Can you think of objective metrics that would quantitatively capture the features you observe?   



To better understand both the drivers of seasonal cycles and their implications it is important to develop objective, quantitative metrics that summarize seasonal cycles.  While there are many possible metrics that can be used - each having different advantages/disadvantages - we will explore two particularly useful metrics that capture the seasonal timing and seasonal concentration of time-series data.  


The metrics we will use were first described in a paper by Markham (1970).  These metrics have since been applied to many subsequent studies.  Furthermore, many other studies have developed very similar metrics that are also widely used.  


The Seasonality Index (SI) describes how uniformly a given variable is spread across the months.  The SI ranges from 0 to 1, with a value of 0 indicating that the variable is evenly spread across the months and a value of 1 indicating that the variable is concentration within a single month.  

The Seasonal Concentration (SC) describes the time of year that the values are most concentrated.  The SC is represented by an angular direction ranging from 0 to 360, thus a value of 0 would indicate the the variable is most focused in the month of January while a value of 180 would indicate the variable being most focused in June.  A bit further down I will introduce the mathematical approach to calculating SI and SC, though first let's continue to look at the Boston and San Francisco data to get a better conceptual understanding of these metrics.  



```{r}
df_seasonality_bos_sfo <- monthly_met_bos_sfo %>% 
  compute_seaonality_indices()
```


```{r}
monthly_met_bos_sfo %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = 15+ (Month-1)*30, y = observation_value, color = group_name)) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, xend = 15+ (Month-1)*30, yend = observation_value),
               size = 1.25, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc")) ) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Black","Blue")) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,90,180,270,360), limits = c(0,360)) +
  coord_polar() +
  
  facet_wrap(~ group_name)
```

I've computed the seasonality indices (SI and SC) for the Boston and San Francisco precipitation data and below I've presented the  the results.  


```{r}
df_seasonality_bos_sfo %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = SC, y = SI, color = group_name)) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, xend = SC, yend = SI),
               size = 2, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.03, "npc")) ) +
  
  scale_color_manual(values = c("Black","Blue")) +
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,90,180,270,360), limits = c(0,360)) +
  coord_polar() +
  
  theme_bw(base_size = 14) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  
  labs(title = "Precipitation seasonality",
       caption = "Boston (blue) and San Francisco (black)")
```




## Precipitation seasonality across the US

Now we are going to compute seasonality indices (SI and SC) for each US state using the method introduced above.  First let's load in monthly precipitation data for all of the states in the US (excluding AK and HI).  You'll recall working with this data, which comes from NOAA, in some prior class exercises.  


```{r}
precip_data <- read_csv("https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Data/NOAA_State_Precip_LabData.csv")

```

Take a look at the dataset to refresh your memory of what it contains.  You'll see that it has monthly values for precipitation for each state and each year from 1895 through 2017.  

Using just the data from 1980 onward, let's compute the average precipitation in each month for each state.

```{r}
df_monthly_normals <- precip_data %>% 
  filter(Year >= 1980) %>% 
  
  group_by(state_cd, Month) %>% 
  summarize(observation_value = mean(Precip_inches)) %>% 
  
  rename(group_name = state_cd)
```

Take a look at the data frame you just created, which contains monthly precipitation normals for each state.  Make sure you understand what is in the data frame and that everything looks sensible.   


Since we want to compute the seasonality indices SI and SC on this data we are going to need some code to do that.  I've written a function in R to compute these indices.  Let's go ahead a load in this function from our class github site. 

```{r}
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/stahlm/stahlm.github.io/master/ENS_215/Winter_2022/Lectures/compute_seasonality_indices.R")
```

You'll now see in your environment pane that you have a function called `compute_seasonality_indices()`.  This is the function we will use to compute the SI and SC indices.  If you click on the function in your environment pane the source code will pop up.  Go ahead and do this.  


FYI, if you want you can also download the R file from my [github site](https://github.com/stahlm/stahlm.github.io/blob/master/ENS_215/Winter_2022/Lectures/compute_seasonality_indices.R).  


Now let's use the `compute_seaonality_indices()` function to compute the indices.  

```{r}
df_seasonality_precip <- compute_seaonality_indices(df_monthly_normals)
```
Take a look at the `df_seasonality_precip` data frame to make sure you understand what it contains.  


You can see that we now have a data frame that has precipitation seasonality indices SI and SC for each US state!  Let's create a figure to examine these results.  


```{r fig.width = 4.5, fig.height= 6.5}
df_seasonality_precip %>% 
  ggplot(aes(y = reorder(group_name, SI), x = SI)) +
  
  geom_point(size = 2) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0, xend = SI, yend = group_name)) +
  
  theme_bw(base_size = 12) +
  labs(x = "SI", y = "State") 
```

Take some time to look over these results.  What key patterns/features do you observe?  What might explain these features (e.g., what do you think is responsible for the wide range of SI values between states)?  Discuss with your neighbors and think about some additional analysis you could do to help answer any hypotheses you've come up with.  




```{r fig.width= 8, fig.height= 3}
df_monthly_normals %>% 
  filter(group_name %in% c("RI", "CA", "ID")) %>% 
  
  ggplot() +
  geom_col(aes(x = factor(Month), y = observation_value)) +
  
  facet_wrap(~ group_name) +
  
  theme_bw() +
  
  labs(x = "Month", y = "Precipitation (inches)")
```

  ggplot(aes(x = SC, y = SI, group = group_name)) +
  
  geom_segment(aes(y = 0, xend = SC, yend = SI),
               size = 0.75, arrow = arrow(length = unit(0.1, "npc")), color = "blue" ) +
  
  
  
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(0,90,180,270,360), limits = c(0,360)) +
  coord_polar() +
  theme_bw(base_size = 3) +
  
  geofacet::facet_geo(~ group_name)
```




```{r}
state_dictionary <- tibble(NAME = state.name, state_cd = state.abb)
```


```{r}
df_seasonality_precip <- df_seasonality_precip %>% 
  rename(state_cd = group_name) %>% 
  left_join(state_dictionary)
```



```{r}
sf_states <- spData::us_states
```


```{r}
sf_seasonality_precip <- sf_states %>% 
  right_join(df_seasonality_precip)
```


```{r}
sf_seasonality_precip %>% 
  tm_shape(bbox = st_bbox(sf_states)) +
  tm_polygons(col = "SI", style = "cont", palette = "viridis")+
  
  tm_shape(sf_states) +
  tm_borders() 
```
