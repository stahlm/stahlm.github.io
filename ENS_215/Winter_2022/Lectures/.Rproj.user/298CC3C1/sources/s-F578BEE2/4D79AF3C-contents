```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)

library(sf)

library(tmap)
library(spData)

```



Note the difference between a data frame with spatial information and a **simple features (sf)** data frame

```{r}
sf_states <- spData::us_states

df_states <- map_data("state")
```



Note how we add layers (similar to adding layers in ggplot) to our **leaflet** and our **tmap** maps

```{r}

```
