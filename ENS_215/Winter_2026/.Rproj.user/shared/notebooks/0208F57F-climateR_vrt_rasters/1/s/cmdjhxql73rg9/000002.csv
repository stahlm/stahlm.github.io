# We noticed you have dplyr installed. The dplyr lag() function breaks how    #
# base R's lag() function is supposed to work, which breaks lag(my_xts).      #
#                                                                             #
# Calls to lag(my_xts) that you enter or source() into this session won't     #
# work correctly.                                                             #
#                                                                             #
# All package code is unaffected because it is protected by the R namespace   #
# mechanism.                                                                  #

# Set `options(xts.warn_dplyr_breaks_lag = FALSE)` to suppress this warning.  #

# You can use stats::lag() to make sure you're not using dplyr::lag(), or you #
# can add conflictRules('dplyr', exclude = 'lag') to your .Rprofile to stop   #
# dplyr from breaking base R's lag() function.                                #
