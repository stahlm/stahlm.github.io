<br/>

We've been working with the `dplyr` package for the past few classes and we've seen just how powerful it is when manipulating/transforming data.  So far you've used the `dplyr` functions summarized in the table below  

`dplyr` function   | Description
-------------------|-------------
`filter()`         | Subset by row values
`arrange()`        | Sort rows by column values
`select()`         | Subset columns
`mutate()`         | Add new columns


Today we are going to introduce a few more `dplyr` functions that will help you with data manipulation and data analysis.  In particular we are going to see how the functions `group_by` and `summarize` allow you do yield rapid insight into your data.  Then we'll work on a bunch of exercises to reinforce/test the concepts that you've learned.  

**Note:** Before starting make sure to clear your **Environment** so that we can get rid of any data objects from last class.  To do this you can go to your **Environment** tab and click the icon that looks like a broom.  

## Load in the `dplyr` package and the `gapminder` package
We'll load in `tidyverse` which contains `dplyr` (as well as many other packages).  We will also load in the `gapminder` library so we can continue to work with the `gapminder` data we've been using in the past few lectures.
```{r message = FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(readr) # we'll use this package later in the lecture to load in files from our class website
library(gapminder)
```

<br/>

We'll create our own copy of the gapminder data that we'll use in the upcoming sections.  
```{r}
my_gap <- gapminder
```

<br/>


### Revisiting `mutate()` and learning some additional applications/approaches 
We often want to create new variables (columns) in a dataset, where the new variable is a function of existing variables.  For instance if we have a column with precipitation data in inches, we might want to create a new column that has the same precipitation data in centimeters.  In this case we would simply multiply our precipitation in inches by 2.54 (number of cm per inch) to get the new, desired column.  

Let's create a new column in our `my_gap` dataset that has the total GDP (i.e. per capita GDP multiplied by the population)

```{r}
mutate(my_gap, 
       tot_gdp = gdpPercap * pop)
```
<br/>

We calculated this new variable.  However, remember if we want to save this information we need to assign it to a data object.  Let's save this new column to our `my_gap` data
```{r}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, 
                 tot_gdp = gdpPercap * pop) 
```

Take at look at your `my_gap` data to confirm that you've added this new variable.  

+ In 1952 which country had the largest total GDP? (Rely on the `dplyr` functions to help you here)
+ In 2007 which country had the largest total GDP?

<br/>

Ok now create a new column called `pop_mill` that has the population in millions (e.g. 1,000,000 should appear as 1) and assign make sure to add this variable to your `my_gap` data
```{r}
# Your code here 
```

Make sure you understand exactly what is going on in the code above.  If you have any questions, discuss with your neighbor or me before moving ahead.  

<br/>

#### Vector functions with `mutate()`
We can also apply functions to the data when creating a new column (variable).  We can perform just about any mathematical operation (you've already seen multiplication when creating a new variable) -- for a list of additional operations check out your `dplyr` cheatsheet.  

For instance, we might want to create a new column that has the log~10~ of the population data.  In this case we can simply employ the `log10` function in our `mutate()` operation
```{r}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, 
                 log10_pop = log10(pop))
```

<br/>

Try out the `mutate()` function to create a new variable `gdp_percap_ratio`, where you divide all of the per capita GDP values, by the maximum per capita GDP observed.  This will allow you to see how a given observation compares to the maximum observed.  
```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, 
                 gdp_percap_ratio = gdpPercap/max(gdpPercap))
```
Take a look at the results and think about what you are observing.

<br/>

#### Conditional statements with `if_else()`
We often want to create a new variable using `mutate()` where the values are based on some conditional statement.  For example, we might want to create a categorical variable where countries are labeled "lower-income" or "higher-income" based on their per capita GDP.  

We can use the `if_else()` function with `mutate()` to do these types of operations.  First let's create a new variable `income_status` and assign it to `my_gap`.
```{r}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, 
                 income_status = if_else(gdpPercap > 7500, "higher-income","lower-income")) 
```

Take a look at `my_gap` and make sure you understand what we did here before moving on.  

<br/>

Now try creating your own variable using the `mutate()` and `if_else()` functions and add this variable to your `my_gap` data
```{r}
# Your code here
```

<br/>

#### Conditional statements with `case_when()`
The `if_else()` function is great when you have just two cases that you would like to assign (e.g. "lower-income" and "higher-income").  However, there are instances where we would like to assign values based on more than two cases.  In this instances we can use the `case_when()` function.  

Let's change our `income_status` variable to cover three cases, "low income", "middle income", and "high income".  
```{r}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, 
                 income_status = case_when(gdpPercap > 7500 ~ "high income", 
                                           gdpPercap > 3500 & gdpPercap <= 7500 ~ "middle income", 
                                           gdpPercap <= 3500 ~ "low income") )
```

<br/>

Now create a variable `life_exp_status` where:  
"**high life exp**" if life expectancy is > 72  
"**med life exp**" if life exp is <= 72 and > 65   
"**low life exp**" otherwise.  
```{r}
# Your code here 
```

<br/>



### Rename variables with `rename()`
We often want to rename columns (variables) in a dataset.  Often, we'll load in data that has a column name that we don't like for one reason or another (too long, not descriptive, includes spaces or odd characters,...).  We can use the `rename()` function to do this.  

Let's rename the columns in our `my_gap` data so that they are all in a consistent format/style.  For this example let's have only lower case letters in our column names and lets indicate spaces between words with and underscore `_`.  This means that we'll need to rename our `lifeExp` and `gdpPercap` column and the other columns can remain unchanged.

```{r}
my_gap <- rename(my_gap, 
                 life_exp = lifeExp, 
                 gdp_per_cap = gdpPercap)
```

<br/>

#### Quick aside regarding the `select()` function
Remember how we used the select function to keep only the variable we wanted?  We'll there is some additional functionality that you can use with `select()` that you will now appreciate.  

Imagine we have a dataset with lots of variables and we only wanted to select variable using some criteria of their name.  We can use some helper functions with `select()` to perform these operations.  

Imagine we just wanted the year, country, and any columns containing gdp information.  Since our columns with gdp information, all have "gdp" somewhere in the name, we can use the `contains()` function with `select()`
```{r}
select(my_gap, year, country, contains("gdp"))
```
Take a look at the output and make sure you understand what is going on.  Also take a look at your `dplyr` cheatsheet and you'll see some other functions that you can use with `select()`.  

Try testing out some of these functions that you can use with `select()`.  While we don't have very many columns in our current dataset, you can imagine these select functions will become more and more useful as the number of variables grows.  
```{r}
# Your code here
```


<br/>


### Select n rows by a variable ranking `top_n()`
We are often interested in the selecting rows (observations) based on their rank.  For instance, we might want to just get the top 10 observations by life expectancy.  We can use the  `top_n()` function to do this.  

```{r}
top_n(my_gap, 10, life_exp) # top 10 countries by life expectancy
```

<br/> 

What were the top 10 countries by total GDP in 1952.  Make sure to output the list in descending order by total GDP.  You'll probably want to use `top_n()` in addition other `dplyr` function.
```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
filter(my_gap, year == 1952) %>% 
  top_n(10, tot_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_gdp))
```

<br/> 

What were the top 10 countries by total GDP in 2007.  Make sure to output the list in descending order by total GDP.  You'll probably want to use `top_n()` in addition other `dplyr` function.  

```{r echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
filter(my_gap, year == 2007) %>% 
  top_n(10, tot_gdp) %>% 
  arrange(desc(tot_gdp))
```

```{r}
# Your code here
```
Did the top 10 countries change much between 1952 and 2007?

<br/>


### `summarize()`
When analyzing a dataset, we are often interested in generating a table with statistics that summarize that data.  As the name suggests the `summarize()` function helps us do just that.  

Let's compute average life expectancies and per capita GDP on our `gap_data`.  Before doing this, let's filter our data so we are just looking at year 2007.  

```{r}
my_gap_2007 <- filter(my_gap, year == 2007)
```

<br/>

Now, let's use the `summarize()` function.  The basic syntax is the `summarize(dataset, variable_name_1 = statistic, variable_name_2 = statistic,...)`.  

Note: both the American English spelling `summarize()` and British English spelling `summarise()` will work.  

```{r}
summarize(my_gap_2007, 
          avg_life = mean(life_exp), 
          avg_gdp_per_cap = mean(gdp_per_cap) )
```

You can use a ton of other summary statistics functions (see your `dplyr` cheatsheet).  

Create a few more summary tables using your `my_gap` data (note you may want to filter your data first as we did with year 2007).  

```{r}
# Your code here 
```


You can use a ton of other summary statistics functions (see your `dplyr` cheatsheet).  

Create a few more summary tables using your `my_gap` data (note you may want to filter your data first as we did with year 2007).  Try to test out some of the additional summary statistics functions from the `dplyr` cheatsheet.    
```{r}
# Your code here 
```

## `group_by()` and `summarize()`
As you've seen, the `summarize()` function is really powerful.  However, when we first group our data and then summarize we can often do so much more.  Let's see just how powerful `summarize()` is when we've first employed the `group_by()` function.  

The `group_by()` function will create a "grouped" copy of a table and subsequent `dplyr` operations will manipulate each group separately and then the results will be combined.  

<br/>

Let's try out an example to help make this clearer.  You want to determine the minimum, mean, and maximum life expectancy observed on each continent in the year 2007.  So first let's group our `my_gap_2007` data by continent
```{r}
my_gap_2007 <- group_by(my_gap_2007, continent) # group the data by continent
```

<br/>

Now, let's apply the `summarize()` function to our "grouped" dataset
```{r}
summarize(my_gap_2007, 
          min_life = min(lifeExp), 
          mean_life = mean(lifeExp), 
          max_life = max(lifeExp))
```

<br/>

Look at that!  We've now got a summary table telling us the minimum, average, and maximum life expectancies observed on each continent in the year 2007!  We did this with just a few lines of code!  Really beats, creating a `for` loop to loop over each continent and compute the statistics.  

<br/>

You can even group by multiple variables.  This is often incredibly useful.  For instance, we might want to see how the life expectancy statistics by continent have changed over time.  In this case we would group by continent and year before applying the `summarize()` function.

```{r}
my_gap <- group_by(my_gap, continent, year) # group by continent then year
```

```{r}
summarize(my_gap, 
          min_life = min(lifeExp), 
          mean_life = mean(lifeExp), 
          max_life = max(lifeExp))
```

<br/>

Pretty cool right!  

FYI, if you want to ungroup a dataset that you've grouped, you can use the `ungroup()` function.  You can of course always regroup the data if you want.  

Also remember that there are tons of statistics functions that you can use with `summarize()`.  Take a look the the **Summary Functions** section of your `dplyr` cheatsheet for more info.  


```{r}
my_gap <- ungroup(my_gap) # ungroup the my_gap data
```

<br/>

### `group_by()` with other `dplyr` functions 
While `group_by()` is often used along with `summarize()`, you can use `group_by()` with other `dplyr` functions as well.  

<br/> 

We can grab the top three per capita GDPs for each of the years that data was collected.  To do this we'll need to group the data by year and then apply the `top_n()` function.  I'm going to use the pipe operator to do all of this in a single line of code.  
```{r}
my_gap %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  top_n(3, gdpPercap)
```

<br/>


You can see that this worked, but the data was sorted in alphabetical order by country.  It would be more useful to have the data sorted by year.  Let's modify the code above to sort the data too.  
```{r}
my_gap %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  top_n(3, gdpPercap) %>% 
  arrange(year)
```

<br/>

Take a look at the summary table.  Did you find anything interesting?  

<br/>

You've seen how `group_by` can be powerfully combined with `dplyr` functions, in particular the `summarize()` function.  Now try out several interesting things of your own.  Think of a few interesting question that you'd like to answer and answer them below.
```{r}
# Your code here

## Exercises with `gapminder` data 
At this point in the term we've established a pretty solid toolkit for programming in R and doing some data wrangling and analysis.  Below are some exercises that will allow you to test out your skills, with a specific focus on the `dplyr` tools that you are now familiar with.  Remember you can use the pipe `%>%` operator to easily string together many operations.   

<br/>

1. Using only the data for year 2007, create a table that reports the following for each **continent** in the `my_gap` dataset
    i) The minimum, maximum and mean per capita GDP  
    ii) The minimum, maximum and mean life expectancy  
    iii) The number of countries in that continent  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

  
```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

my_gap %>% filter(year == 2007) %>% 
  group_by(continent) %>% 
  summarise(gdp_percap_min = min(gdpPercap), 
            gdp_percap_max = max(gdpPercap), 
            gdp_percap_mean = mean(gdpPercap), 
            life_min = min(lifeExp), 
            life_max = max(lifeExp), 
            life_mean = mean(lifeExp), 
            num_country = n())

```

<br/>

2. Create a table that reports the following for each **country** in the `my_gap` dataset
    i) The ratio of the **total** GDP between the most recent (last recorded year) and the earliest (first recorded year)
    ii) The ratio of the **per capita** GDP between the most recent (last recorded year) and the earliest (first recorded year)
    iii) The change in life expectancy during the period of record (i.e. between the last recorded year and the first recorded year)

Save the table to a new object called `gap_summary_table` and sort this table in descending order by the change in life expectancy.  Did you notice anything interesting?  Think about what might explain the observed changes.

Next sort this same table in ascending order based on life expectancy.  Do you observe anything interesting?  

Once you've done the above, try sorting the table according to the ratio of per capita GDP

**Hint**: Look at your `dplyr` cheatsheet in the "Summary Functions" section for some functions that will be useful for the exercise above

```{r}
# Your code here
```

    
```{r eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE}
my_gap <- mutate(my_gap, tot_gdp = pop*gdpPercap) # add a total gdp variable

gap_summary_table <- my_gap %>% 
  group_by(country) %>% 
  summarize(continent = first(continent), 
            gdp_percap_ratio = (last(gdpPercap))/first(gdpPercap),
            gdp_ratio = (last(tot_gdp))/first(tot_gdp), 
            life_exp_change = last(lifeExp) - first(lifeExp) ) %>% 
  arrange(desc(life_exp_change))
```

## Exercises: NOAA precipitation data

Let's take a look at some precipitation data from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency (NOAA) to gain insight into annual and seasonal variability in precipitation for a US state of your choosing.  

The dataset that we will use has monthly precipitation data from 1895 through 2017 for each US state.  We are going to generate a summary of annual precipitation for each year on record for your state of interest.  For example if you choose NY, you will create a dataframe that has the total annual precipitation for NY for each year from 1895 through 2017.  If you didn't have the tools from the `dplyr` package you would have to do this using a loop and indexing the dataframe with base R (cumbersome, requires more coding, harder to read, more prone to making a coding error).  Thankfully we've learned how to use `dplyr`.  


<br/>

First we'll load in dataset from last week
```{r}
precip_data <- read_csv("https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Data/NOAA_State_Precip_LabData.csv")
```

<br/>

Take a few minutes to look at the dataset to familiarize yourself with it (e.g. view it, use the `summary()` function,...).  

Now let's select a state of interest.  Remember that if we weren't using `dplyr` we would have to select the state of interest using code like what is shown directly below.  
```{r eval = FALSE}
state_2_get <- "NY" # Abbreviation code for state I want to select

state_data <- precip_data[precip_data$state_cd == state_2_get, ] # get the rows with desired state, and get all columns
```


<br/>

That code works, but it is cumbersome to write, easy to make an error, and sort of difficult to decipher.  We can do much better now.  

Use `dplyr` to create a `state_data` object that has all of the data for your state of choosing.  

```{r}
# Your code here
```


```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
state_2_get <- "CA" # Abbreviation code for state I want to select

state_data <- filter(precip_data, state_cd == state_2_get)
```

<br/>

Ok, now let's proceed to the exercises below which will allow you to demonstrate/test your `dplyr` skills and will highlight just how powerful the `dplyr` package is.  

Some of these exercises will be challenging, so make sure to consult your `dplyr` cheatsheet, discuss with your classmates and me.  

**Some helpful advice:** Remember to think step-by-step.  Test each step as you go.  Even for an experienced programmer/scientist it is often necessary to break the task into smaller chunks.  Piping with `%>%` can make your task easier by allowing you to combine many individual steps together.  If you finish all of the exercises you should go back and take more time to examine your results and think about the environmental siginificane/implications.  

<br/>

Now use the tools from `dplyr` to do the following:

1. For your chosen state create a table that has
    i) The monthly average precipitation (i.e. for January you would take the average of all the January data, for Feb…)  
    ii) Minimum observed precipitation for a given month  
    iii) Maximum observed precipitation for a given month  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

state_data %>% group_by(Month) %>% 
  summarize(m_avg = mean(Precip_inches), 
            m_min = min(Precip_inches), 
            m_max = max(Precip_inches)) 

```
  
<br/>


2. For your chosen state, create a table that has  
    i) total annual precipitation for each year on record  

```{r}
# Your code here
```


```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

state_data %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(tot_ann_precip = sum(Precip_inches))

```

  
<br/>


3. Using the dataset `precip_data`, which has data for all of the states, create a single table that has  
    i) The total annual precipitation for each year, for each state (e.g. total annual precip for all years on record for Alabama, same for Arkansas, ... , same for New York, ...)  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

t3 <- precip_data %>% 
  group_by(state_cd, Year) %>%
  summarize(annual_precip = sum(Precip_inches))

```


<br/>


4. Using your table from the exercise above, create another table that has  
    i) The same statistics, but just for the wettest state in each year (i.e. the one with the highest total precip for that year)  
    ii) Sort this table by year (in ascending order)  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

t3 %>% 
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  top_n(1, annual_precip) %>% 
  arrange(Year)
```

  
<br/>


5. Using the dataset `precip_data`, which has data for all of the states, create a table that has  
    i) Average annual precipitation for each state (i.e. a single value for each state.  For instance NY might have averaged 45 inches of rain annually from 1895-2017, CA might have averaged...)  
    ii) Minimum annual precipitation recorded for each state (i.e. a single value for each state)  
    iii) Maximum annual precipitation recorded for each state (i.e. a single value for each state)  
    iv) Sort the table by the average annual precipitation (desending order)  
  
**Hint:** There are many ways to do this, however it might help to make an "intermediate" table of stats that you then operate on to get your final table (this isn't necessary, but might help)  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

t5 <- precip_data %>% 
  group_by(state_cd, Year) %>% 
  summarize(tot_annual_precip = sum(Precip_inches)) %>% 
  group_by(state_cd) %>%  
  summarize(mean_precip = mean(tot_annual_precip),
            min_precip = min(tot_annual_precip),
            max_precip = max(tot_annual_precip)) %>% 
  arrange(desc(mean_precip))

```


<br/>


6. **Challenge**: For your chosen state do the following  
    i) Add a new variable (column) called `season` to your `state_data` that has a "flag" (categorical value) that takes the value "season-1" if the month is March through August and takes the value "season-2" otherwise    
    ii) Now using your `state_data` create a table that reports for each year of record the ratio of precipitation in **season-1** to the ratio of the total precipitation in that same year.  
  
This table will allow us to see how the seasonal distribution of precipitation may have changed (or not) over the years on record.  

```{r}
# Your code here
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo=FALSE}

state_data <- mutate(state_data, 
                     season = if_else(Month %in% c(3,4,5,6,7,8), "season-1", "season-2"))

t6 <-  state_data %>% 
  group_by(Year, season) %>% 
  summarize(precip_seasonal = sum(Precip_inches)) %>%
  group_by(Year) %>% 
  summarize(precip_ratio = first(precip_seasonal)/sum(precip_seasonal) )

```
