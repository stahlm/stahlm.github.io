\begin{quote}
\emph{We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The
world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put
together the right information at the right time, think critically about
it, and make important choices wisely.}\\
-- Edward O. Wilson
\end{quote}

Understanding how the Earth and environment works requires the careful
analysis and interpretation of scientific data. Increasingly, the
limitations to our understanding lie not in the availability of data,
but rather in our ability to analyze and find meaning in it. Deriving
insight from environmental data, in particular large and complex
datasets, requires new tools, methods, and ways of thinking. In this
class we are going to learn how to code in the programming language R
and use it to analyze environmental data in order to better understand
the Earth's systems. This course will feature a hands-on classroom with
programming and data analysis occurring interactively during the class.
Students will learn how to analyze and visualize large datasets (``big
data'') and how to write code, while also covering interesting
components of environmental and Earth sciences. The datasets used
throughout the term will be research quality (e.g., from peer-reviewed
publications, government agencies, your thesis data) and will address a
range of global challenges including climate change, water resources,
biodiversity loss, ecological and environmental degradation, energy
resources, and agricultural production. The term will culminate with a
``research conference'' where each student will deliver a presentation
on the environmental data analysis project they conducted over the
course of the term. These projects involve the in-depth analysis of
research quality datasets (e.g., data from NASA, USGS, EPA, NOAA) to
address a research question(s) posed by each student and are an
opportunity for each student to develop and conduct an original research
project on an environmental topic of their interest.

\hypertarget{course-premise}{%
\subsection{Course premise}\label{course-premise}}

This course will be taught as a \textbf{``flipped''} class. This means
that you will learn some of the basic material outside of class --
through online assignments/tutorials, readings, and watching videos --
while you will ``learn by doing'' through hands on programming exercises
during class.

At the start of each class you will be given a packet with the days
work. You should keep these handouts as they will serve as part of your
course notes. During class you will work through the project laid out in
the packet and at the end of class you will have an R Notebook that has
all of your code, results, and notes. You will then apply what you
learned in class to your weekly homework assignments. You can not rush
through the class work as care and thought are required to learn the
concepts needed for the assignments and later classes.

\hypertarget{assignments}{%
\section{Assignments}\label{assignments}}

\hypertarget{code-notebooks}{%
\subsection{Code notebooks}\label{code-notebooks}}

You will spend part of each class meeting working on that day's code
notebook. However, many of the notebooks will require work outside of
class time to complete. It is important to work through these notebooks
carefully, taking good notes, answering the prompts/questions I have
given, and trying out new and novel analyses. At the end of each week
you will submit that week's code notebooks as final rendered
\textbf{html files}.

\hypertarget{online-tutorials}{%
\subsection{Online tutorials}\label{online-tutorials}}

These tutorials are required and are a very helpful and important part
of teaching you how to code in the short timeframe of one term. The
tutorials help to make learning to code a much more enjoyable and
efficient process and also serve as an excellent refresher once you've
learned coding. There will typically be a tutorial assignment for every
class topic. If you come to class and work diligently you should be able
to complete the tutorials As the tutorials builds off of the in-class
material, coming to class is necessary. I have set up a class group on
the site where the tutorials are hosted and I will be able to monitor
and track your progress. Successful completion of the tutorial will
result in a 100\% grade for that assignment. If the tutorial is not
fully completed then you will receive a score equal to the percent that
you completed at the time the assignment was due. Note that the there is
an option to take hints during the tutorials. Taking hints does affect
your final score (however a single hint typically has a minimal effect)
so use them sparingly.

\hypertarget{labs}{%
\subsection{Labs}\label{labs}}

In lab you will be given a dataset from the Earth and environmental
sciences with the goal of exploring and discovering interesting features
and illuminating important scientific concepts. You will be given
background information and the data you will need to successfully
complete the lab, though successful completion of the lab will require
independent and creative exploratory analysis. The goal of the lab
assignments is to apply the tools and concepts learned in class towards
asking and answering interesting scientific questions. These labs are
intended to improve your skills in data analysis, learn about concepts
from Earth and environmental sciences, and importantly to develop skills
as a creative and independent researcher. These skills will serve you
will in future classes, grad school, and jobs.

\hypertarget{final-project}{%
\subsection{Final project}\label{final-project}}

Each student will produce a report/presentation based on their analysis
of an environmental/Earth science dataset. You will develop
questions/hypotheses about your dataset and use the skills we have
learned throughout the term to tackle these questions. You can analyze a
dataset that you are interested and find on your own or I can point you
to an interesting dataset. If you are doing a senior thesis or
independent research project, this is a great opportunity to start
analyzing that data. During the last week of class we will have a mini
conference session where each student will present their work.
Additional details on the final project will be provided later in the
term.

\hypertarget{pop-quizzes}{%
\subsection{Pop-quizzes}\label{pop-quizzes}}

We will have pop-quizzes 6-8 times throughout the term. The quizzes will
test concepts that you have learned recently and they will help you
gauge your grasp of the recent course material. \textbf{These quizzes
will take place in the first 5 minutes of class}, so make sure to be on
time. \textbf{There are no make-up pop-quizzes.}. Your lowest pop-quiz
grade will be dropped.

\hypertarget{my-expectations}{%
\subsection{My Expectations}\label{my-expectations}}

I want and expect the class to be an engaging and enjoyable environment
for all students. We should all work together in a positive and
respectful manner and every student should feel comfortable contributing
to class discussions and asking questions. All students must comply with
the Union College honor code. This includes but is not limited to issues
of cheating and plagiarism. If you have any doubts about whether you are
in compliance with the honor code you should ask me for guidance prior
to submitting the material in question.

\hypertarget{computer-use}{%
\subsection{Computer use}\label{computer-use}}

We will use computers in all of our class and lab meetings. If you have
a personal laptop you can use it or you can use the computers in the
classroom. \textbf{Using your computer for anything not related to the
class is unacceptable and will adversely impact your participation
grade}. Among other things, this means that you should not check email,
Instagram, Twitter, news, or any other content not directly related to
the coursework during class/lab meetings. Your undivided attention and
focus is important to your success in this class.

\hypertarget{phone-use}{%
\subsection{Phone use}\label{phone-use}}

Phones should not be used during class. Please do not leave phones on
the desks/tables as they create a distraction that interferes with you
and your classmates' ability to focus on the class material.

\hypertarget{policy-on-the-use-of-ai-tools}{%
\subsection{Policy on the use of AI
tools}\label{policy-on-the-use-of-ai-tools}}

\textbf{Policy:} The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI)
tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini,\ldots) to generate material submitted as
part of a graded assignments in this class is NOT permitted. If you have
any questions about whether or not a tool/resource is acceptable for use
in this class, feel free to ask me.

\textbf{Justification:} One of the central goals of this course is for
students to develop and hone their problem solving abilities (see our
\protect\hyperlink{learning-objectives}{Learning objectives}). In
particular, students will learn how to derive understanding from
datasets - a process that requires careful thought about how the data is
structured/organized, the types of data within the dataset, the
potential limitations of the data, and ultimately formulate questions
that can be asked and answered with the data. This process requires
bringing together programming skills, creative problem-solving skills,
mathematics/statistics, and data visualization and melding them with
your domain knowledge related the scientific question(s) you are
addressing. While generative AI tools can help you generate computer
code (and may even assist you in other areas) they will rob you of the
opportunity to actually develop these skills and problem-solving
abilities. Reliance on generative AI tools stunts the development of the
underlying mental/cognitive skills needed to think about and formulate
interesting questions and thus limits your ability to actively engage
with scientific discovery. While, there are indeed useful applications
of generative AI tools, they are in conflict with the goals of this
class and we will not use them.

\hypertarget{class-attendance-and-participation}{%
\subsection{Class attendance and
participation}\label{class-attendance-and-participation}}

\textbf{You are expected to attend every class and to arrive on time}. I
will have a sign-in sheet that you will need to sign as you enter class.
Missing class or arriving late will significantly impact your class
participation grade. This course is very hands-on and you will learn by
doing, so missing class will make it very difficult to succeed.
Furthermore, this class is very interactive and you will learn from and
teach your classmates so attendance is important to supporting the best
learning environment for all. While some people like to wear headphones
when coding, this is not allowed during class or lab as it interferes
with participation/collaboration. If you have to miss class for a
legitimate reason let me know ahead of time.

\hypertarget{due-dates}{%
\subsection{Due-dates}\label{due-dates}}

\textbf{All assignments must be turned in on time}. Homework is due
prior to the start of class on the date it is due. Labs are due prior to
the start of lab on the day the assignment is due. In the case of online
tutorials (e.g.~DataCamp assignments) you will receive a grade
corresponding to the percent of the tutorial successfully completed at
the time the assignment was due (e.g.~if you successfully completed 85\%
of the tutorial at the time it was due, then you would receive and
85\%). For other assignments, I will use the time-stamp on Nexus to
determine if the assignment was turned in on time. Late assignments
(\emph{not including online tutorials}) will lose 12.5 pts/day and will
not be accepted if \textgreater{} 3 days late.

\hypertarget{email-policy}{%
\subsection{Email policy}\label{email-policy}}

I try to respond to emails in a reasonably timely manner, however do not
expect rapid replies late at night or on weekends. If you have a
question about coding you should first try the class notes, checking
your textbook, Googling the question, R help files, my office hours,
etc. before emailing. Please state your question as clearly as possible.
Also, please make sure to reply to confirm that you've received my
response (a simple `Thanks, got it' is often all that's needed), as this
is a good habit to develop in your academic and professional careers.

\hypertarget{collaboration}{%
\subsection{Collaboration}\label{collaboration}}

I encourage collaboration and an interactive environment. Talking
problems over with classmates is an excellent way to overcome challenges
and to teach and learn from one another. However, it is critical that
all work you submit is your own. This means that discussing approaches,
techniques, and things to look out for are all great but copying
someone's code is absolutely not allowed and constitutes plagiarism.

\hypertarget{honor-code}{%
\subsection{Honor code}\label{honor-code}}

Union College recognizes the need to create an environment of mutual
trust as part of its educational mission. Responsible participation in
an academic community requires respect for and acknowledgement of the
thoughts and work of others, whether expressed in the present or in some
distant time and place. Matriculation at the College is taken to signify
implicit agreement with the Academic Honor Code, available at:
honorcode.union.edu. It is each student's responsibility to ensure that
submitted work is his or her own and does not involve any form of
academic misconduct. Students are expected to ask their course
instructors for clarification regarding, but not limited to,
collaboration, citations, and plagiarism. \textbf{Ignorance is not an
excuse for breaching academic integrity}.

\hypertarget{disabilities}{%
\subsection{Disabilities}\label{disabilities}}

Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities who
are registered with the Office of Student Support Services (8785).
Students in need of disability accommodations should schedule an
appointment with me early in the semester to discuss any accommodations
for this course that have been approved by the college, as indicated on
your OSSS ID card.
