## Class composition by year
```{r}
ggplot(Class_yr) + geom_col(aes(x = Year, y = Count), fill = "mediumseagreen")
```

---

## Class composition by major
```{r}
ggplot(Majors) + geom_col(aes(x = Major, y = Count), fill = "mediumseagreen") 
```

---

## What we've heard of
```{r}
ggplot(Heard_of) + geom_col(aes(x = Topic, y = Count), fill = "mediumseagreen") 
```

#1. Do you think that data science will be an important part of your career?  Why or why not?
#2. What is something you hope to learn in this class?
#3. Do you come across data science in your day to day life?  Examples?
#4. Guess my age...

## You estimated that I am `r mean(My_age$Age)`.  
#ggplot(My_age) + geom_density(aes(x = Age), fill = "blue", alpha = 0.7) + geom_vline(xintercept = 31.7, color = "black",size = 1.5) + geom_vline(xintercept = mean(My_age$Age), color = "red", size = 2)

## Where we are from
#ggplot(States) + geom_bar(aes(x = State), fill = "mediumseagreen")

```
