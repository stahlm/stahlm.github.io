Today is the last lab where we will work on your final project.  In next week's lab (week 10) you will present your completed project to me and your classmates.  

Look back at the [project guidelines](https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Labs/Lab_Final_Project.html) to ensure that the your final project conforms with all of the stated guidelines and that you properly submit your project.

### Important notes

+ Remember that you are to submit a folder containing everything needed to run your code and produce your knitted final project.  Thus your R notebook and all required data should be in this folder (and its sub-folders).  Recall that you should be using relative paths in your code -- I need to be able to download your folder and run the code as is.  

+ Your presentation to the class should be ~10 minutes.  In your presentation you will introduce your topic and dataset, give the necessary background information, discuss your analytical approach, and summarize your results and findings.  You should give a practiced and polished presentation to the class -- the quality of your presentation is part of the overall assessment.
