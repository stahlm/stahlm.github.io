## Course description
>_We are drowning in information, while starving for wisdom. The world henceforth will be run by synthesizers, people able to put together the right information at the right time, think critically about it, and make important choices wisely._  
> -- Edward O. Wilson

Understanding how the Earth and environment works requires the careful analysis and interpretation of scientific data.  Increasingly, the limitations to our understanding lie not in the availability of data, but rather in our ability to analyze and find meaning in it.  Deriving insight from environmental data, in particular large and complex datasets, requires new tools, methods, and ways of thinking.  In this class we are going to learn how to code in the programming language R and use it to analyze environmental data in order to better understand the Earth's systems.  This course will feature a hands-on classroom with programming and data analysis occurring interactively during the class.  Students will learn how to analyze and visualize large datasets and how to write code, while also covering interesting components of environmental and Earth sciences.  

## Course premise
This course will be taught as a **"flipped"** class.  This means that you will learn much of the basic material outside of class -- through online assignments/tutorials, readings, and watching videos -- while you will "learn by doing" through hands on programming exercises during class.  

At the start of each class you will be given a packet with the days work.  You should keep these handouts as they will serve as part of your course notes.  During class you will work through the project laid out in the packet and at the end of class you will have an R Notebook that has all of your code, results, and notes.  You will then apply what you learned in class to your weekly homework assignments.  You can not rush through the class work as care and thought are required to learn the concepts needed for the assignments and later classes.

# Assignments
## Online tutorials
These tutorials are required and are a very helpful and important part of teaching you how to code in the short timeframe of one term.  The tutorials help to make learning to code a much more enjoyable and efficient process and also serve as an excellent refresher once you've learned coding.  I have set up class groups on the sites where the tutorials are hosted and I will be able to track your progress.  Successful completion of the tutorial will result in a 100% grade for that assignment.  If the tutorial is not fully completed then you will receive a score equal to the percent that you completed.

## Homework
There will typically be a homework assignment for every class topic.  If you come to class and work diligently you should be able to complete the homework.  As the homework builds off of the in-class material, coming to class is necessary.  Your homework will be submitted as R Notebooks which consist of your code, annotations/comments, and results all neatly wrapped into a single file.  You will need to add annotations/comments to your code describing what you did and any figures will need to have a caption and axis labels.  **Homework must be submitted to Nexus before the start of the class in which it is due**.

## Labs
In lab you will be given a dataset from the Earth and environmental sciences with the goal of exploring and discovering interesting features and illuminating important scientific concepts.  You will be given background information and the data you will need to successfully complete the lab, though successful completion of the lab will require independent and creative exploratory analysis.  The goal of the lab assignments is to apply the tools and concepts learned in class towards asking and answering interesting scientific questions.  These labs are intended to improve your skills in data analysis, learn about concepts from Earth and environmental sciences, and importantly to develop skills as a creative and independent researcher.  These skills will serve you will in future classes, grad school, and jobs.  

## Final project
Each student will produce a report/presentation based on their analysis of an environmental/Earth science dataset.  You will develop questions/hypotheses about your dataset and use the skills we have learned throughout the term to tackle these questions.  You can analyze a dataset that you are interested and find on your own or I can point you to an interesting dataset.  If you are doing a senior thesis or independent research project, this is a great opportunity to start analyzing that data.  During the last week of class we will have a mini conference session where each student will present their work.  Additional details on the final project will be provided later in the term.

## My Expectations
I want and expect the class to be an engaging and enjoyable environment for all students.  We should all work together in a positive and respectful manner and every student should feel comfortable contributing to class discussions and asking questions.  All students must comply with the Union College honor code.  This includes but is not limited to issues of cheating and plagiarism.  If you have any doubts about whether you are in compliance with the honor code you should ask me for guidance prior to submitting the material in question.

## Computer use
We will use computers in all of our class and lab meetings.  If you have a personal laptop you can use it or you can use the computers in the classroom.  **Using your computer for anything not related to the class is unacceptable and will adversely impact your participation grade**.  Among other things, this means that you should not check email, Instagram, Twitter, news, or any other content not directly related to the coursework during class/lab meetings.  Your undivided attention and focus is important to your success in this class.

## Class attendance and participation
**You are expected to attend every class and to arrive on time**.  I will have a sign-in sheet that you will need to sign as you enter class.  Missing class or arriving late will significantly impact your class participation grade.  This course is very hands-on and you will learn by doing, so missing class will make it very difficult to succeed.  Furthermore, this class is very interactive and you will learn from and teach your classmates so attendance is important to supporting the best learning environment for all.  While some people like to wear headphones when coding, this is not allowed during class or lab as it interferes with participation/collaboration.  If you have to miss class for a legitimate reason let me know ahead of time.  

## Due-dates
**All assignments must be turned in on time**.  Homework is due prior to the start of class on the date it is due.  Labs are due prior to the start of lab on the day the assignment is due.  In the case of online tutorials (e.g. DataCamp assignments) you will recieve a grade corresponding to the percent of the tutorial successfully completed at the time the assignment was due (e.g. if you successfully completed 85% of the tutorial at the time it was due, then you would recieve and 85%).  For other assignments, I will use the time-stamp on Nexus to determine if the assignment was turned in on time.  Late assignments (*not including online tutorials*) will lose 12.5 pts/day and will not be accepted if > 3 days late. 

## Email policy
I try to respond to emails in a reasonably timely manner, however do not expect rapid replies late at night or on weekends.  If you have a question about coding you should first try Googling it, checking your textbook, R help files, my office hours, etc. before emailing.  Please state your question as clearly as possible.  Also, please make sure to reply to confirm that you've received my response (a simple Thanks, got it is often all that's needed), as this is a good habit to develop in your academic and professional careers.

## Collaboration
I encourage collaboration and an interactive environment.  Talking problems over with classmates is an excellent way to overcome challenges and to teach and learn from one another.  However, it is critical that all work you submit is your own.  This means that discussing approaches, techniques, things to look out for are all great but copying someone else's code is absolutely not allowed and constitutes plagiarism.  

## Honor code 
Union College recognizes the need to create an environment of mutual trust as part of its educational mission. Responsible participation in an academic community requires respect for and acknowledgement of the thoughts and work of others, whether expressed in the present or in some distant time and place. Matriculation at the College is taken to signify implicit agreement with the Academic Honor Code, available at: honorcode.union.edu. It is each student's responsibility to ensure that submitted work is his or her own and does not involve any form of academic misconduct. Students are expected to ask their course instructors for clarification regarding, but not limited to, collaboration, citations, and plagiarism.  **Ignorance is not an excuse for breaching academic integrity**.

## Disabilities
Academic accommodations are available for students with disabilities who are registered with the Office of Student Support Services (8785). Students in need of disability accommodations should schedule an appointment with me early in the semester to discuss any accommodations for this course that have been approved by the college, as indicated on your OSSS ID card.
