# Motivation for Project

+ I want to study the impact of multinational and bilateral envrionmental agreements and how various countries relevant envrionmental conditions change or, do not, as consequence of the agreement to determine what the most effective agreements have been and why? I also want to try and determine if any one country stands out as a vangaurd for envrionmental regulations an if so, what conditions might allow for them to lead such a crusade. This is critical to understand, as globally countries need to collaboarte and cooperate to solve the imminent and existential threat that climate change broadly poses to humans, and more specifically the threat of certain pollutants to human health. 

# Scientific Question

+ I will investigate the effectivness of multinational and bilateral envrionmental agreements and then compare the impact the regulatons have had, or not had, on related pollutants or envrionmental data for each country involved.

# Data Sources

### International Environmental Agreements (IEA) Database Project
+ https://iea.uoregon.edu
+ A dataset of all the recorded Multinational Envrionmental Agreements (MEAs) and Bilateral Envrionmental Agreements (BEAs), both binding and nonbinding, for every country.
+ The database currently includes over 1,300 MEAs, over 2,200 BEAs, 250 other environmental agreements, and over 90,000 individual country "membership actions" (dates of signature, ratification, or entry into force; release notes here)
+Information will need to be loaded for each relevant country/agreement in order to determine the number of columns/rows
+ The data set is in an excel sheet format, and the column titles included

mitch_id,	Agreement Signature,Inclusion	Inclusion Auto-Generated,	Agreement Name,	Agreement Termination (if any),	Signatures	Ratifications (or similar),	Entry into force,	1st Withdrawal (or similar),	Rejoining after 1st withdrawal,	2nd Withdrawal (or similar),	Rejoining after 2nd withdrawal,	Entry Into Force (Tacit Acceptance), Objection	Entry Into Force (Tacit Acceptance), and Removal of Objection. Certain datasets that are not country specific but policy specific include a category on the agreement's "subject," such as pollution or water.

### UNSD Environmental Indicators
+ https://unstats.un.org/unsd/envstats/qindicators.cshtml
+ A dataset which includes global envrionmental data for statistics on 10 indicators: 
Air and Climate
 Biodiversity
 Energy and Minerals
 Forests
 Governance
 Inland Water Resources new
 Land and Agriculture
 Marine and Coastal Areas
 Natural Disasters
 Waste new
 + The datasets are in an excel sheet format and the number and rows and columsn will differ depending on which data sets I intend to use. As of now I am focusing on air pollution data related to consumption of ozone-depleting substances, so2 emissions, and co2 emissions, as well as data related to pillution, such as waste disposal. The excel sheets have a drop down menu button at the top where I can pick a specific country to focus on which will help when comparing it to thos parties involved in the agreements.
 + a sample of column names are, "Consumption of CFCs" and "Consumption of all ODS," with a few years listed with recordings.
