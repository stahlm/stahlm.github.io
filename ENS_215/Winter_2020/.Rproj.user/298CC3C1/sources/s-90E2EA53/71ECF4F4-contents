The links below direct you to data and mapping/spatial analysis resources for hydrology and water resources.  Many of these resources are also broadly applicable to anyone doing spatial analysis in the sciences/engineering, social sciences, and humanities.  

I strongly recommend those of you who are interested in map making (and spatial analysis more broadly) to consult the excellent and freely available textbook [Geocomputation with R](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/). 

If you are interested in learning the R programming language (which is a great for spatial analysis) I recommend the excellent and freely available textbook [_ModernDive_](https://moderndive.com/).  You might also be interested in consulting the course notes for my class [_Exploring Environmental Data (ENS-215)_](https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Winter_2020/Home.html) which provides an introduction to programming in R through the context of environmental data.

### Data resources 
+ [USGS National Water Information Service](https://nwis.waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis): Web interface that provides access to USGS water data (e.g. flows, water levels, chemical and biological conditions) for nearly 2 million sites across the US and US territories.  You can also directly query and download data right in R using [USGS R packages](https://owi.usgs.gov/R/training-curriculum/usgs-packages/).  
+ [NOAA Climate Data](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information): Climate datasets for the US and the world.
+ [Natural Earth Data](https://www.naturalearthdata.com/): Site with freely available geospatial dataset (e.g. country borders, river shapefiles, land surface elevation data).
+ [UN FAO Aquastat Data](http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/main/index.stm): UN data on water resources.
+ [NASA Earth Observations](https://neo.sci.gsfc.nasa.gov/): NASA website with information and links to the data from NASA earth observation satellites and other global earth science datasets.  
+ [Compendium of hydrology resources in R](https://github.com/ropensci/hydrology)  
+ [tigris](https://github.com/walkerke/tigris): A package in R to acquire geographic data (e.g. rivers, lakes, roads, county borders,...) directly from the US Census Bureau.  
+ [tidycensus](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html):  A package in R to acquire census data (e.g. demographics, income,...) directly fron the US Census Bureau.  
+ [dataRetrevial](https://github.com/USGS-R/dataRetrieval): A package in R to acquire data directly from the USGS Nation Water Information System (e.g. water quality, streamflow, groundwater levels)
+ [stationaRy](https://github.com/rich-iannone/stationaRy): A package in R to acquire hourly meteorological data from one of thousands of global stations (data is from NOAA). 
+ [gapminder](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/gapminder/README.html): A package in R to get data from the gapminder dataset on global development.  
+ [rnaturalearth](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/rnaturalearth/README.html): A package in R to acquire geospatial data (e.g. country borders, topographic data,...) from Natural Earth repository.


### Spatial analysis packages in R
+ [tmap](https://github.com/mtennekes/tmap): Functions to create high quality maps (both static and dynamic)
+ [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/): Functions to create interactive maps.
+ [raster](https://rspatial.org/raster/pkg/index.html): Functions for reading, writing, and analyzing raster data.
+ [sf](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/index.html): Provides functionality for handling simple features data in R.
