## Learning more
### At Union
We now have a [Data Analytics minor at Union College](https://muse.union.edu/cda/analytics-minor/)!  If you are interested in learning more in this area, adding the minor is a great idea.  

In addition to the classes listed for the minor, there are many other courses at Union that can help you on your way to learning more data analytics, statistics, programming/computing skills.  

I'm happy to offer advice on academic and career paths in these areas (especially as they apply to the environmental fields) and you can also ask other faculty including my colleagues who are also part of the [Center for Data Analytics](https://muse.union.edu/cda/faculty/) 

You can also come into the Center for Data Analytics here at Union for events (talks, hackathons,...) and drop-in hours (in Wold 010) where you can get help with data analytics projects.  


### On your own
+ [Our class (ENS-215) website](https://stahlm.github.io/ENS_215/Winter_2020/Home.html): All of the content will remain up and available to you.
+ [_ModernDive_](https://moderndive.com/): For those of you interested in learning more about statistics and data modeling the later chapters in the book are a great starting point.
+ [_R for Data Science_](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/): As you already know this book is a comprehensive resource for using R in data science applications.  
+ [Hands-On Machine Learning with R](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/): An excellent and free textbook on data modeling and machine learing in R.  This textbook is very accessible and introduces you to many of the most common methods in machine learning.  
+ [_An Introduction to Statistical Learning_](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/): An excellent and freely available textbook that introduces machine learning concepts and applications.  This book is a bit advanced (aimed at upper level undergraduates and graduate students) but is still reasonably accessible.
    + Two of the authors (Prof. Hastie and Tibshirani of Stanford) have made 15 hrs of video lectures that go along with the book.  The lectures are excellent and actually pretty entertaining too (they have great banter with each other).  [You can access the lectures here](https://www.r-bloggers.com/in-depth-introduction-to-machine-learning-in-15-hours-of-expert-videos/).  
+ [_Geocomputation with R_](https://geocompr.robinlovelace.net/): Excellent and freely available text on geographic data analysis, visualization, and modeling.  The book implements these concepts and techniques with R.  The chapter on making maps in R is likely to be of particular interest to many of you.  
+ [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/): There are many additional interactive classes available here covering a wide-range of topics (e.g. machine learning, geographic/spatial analysis, statistics) and their implementation in R.  Your free access lasts for six months, so you will still have access for some time after the term ends.
